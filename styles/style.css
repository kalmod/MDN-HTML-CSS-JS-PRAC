    We could use the margin: 0 auto trick again as we did earlier 
    for the body, but we also need to do something else. The 
    <body> element is block level, meaning it takes up space on 
    the page and can have margin and other spacing values applied 
    to it. Images, on the other hand, are inline elements, meaning 
    they can't. So to apply margins to the image, we have to give 
    the image block-level behavior using display: block;
