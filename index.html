        <!-- <head></head> — the <head> element. This element acts 
            as a container for all the stuff you want to include on 
            the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to 
            your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords
             and a page description that you want to appear in search
              results, CSS to style our content, character set 
              declarations, and more.
            <meta charset="utf-8"> — This element sets the 
            character set your document should use to UTF-8, 
            which includes most characters from the vast majority 
            of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle 
            any textual content you might put on it. There is no 
            reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some 
            problems later on. 
            <title></title> — the <title> element. This sets the 
                title of your page, which is the title that 
                appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. 
                It is also used to describe the page when you 
                bookmark/favourite it.-->

        <!--  The reason we've put the <script> element near the 
            bottom of the HTML file is that HTML is loaded by the 
            browser in the order it appears in the file. If the 
            JavaScript is loaded first and it is supposed to 
            affect the HTML below it, it might not work, as the 
            JavaScript would be loaded before the HTML it is 
            supposed to work on. Therefore, putting JavaScript 
            near the bottom of the HTML page is often the best 
            strategy. -->
